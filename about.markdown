My name is Linda and I live in Åmål. I study computer sience on a distance education.

Previously I have worked as a supportperson for people with neuropsychiatric disabilities.

In my sparetime I enjoy artwork. I like to scetch and draw, both on paper and on the computer. My dogs (Whippets) are also an importent part of my life. They are racers, so I spend a lot of time at the swedish tracks during the summermonths.

The Robots Exclusion Protocol is a way for Web site owners to give instructions about their site to web robots. Web sites use the /robots.txt file for this.

The robots.txt file tells which robots (keyword User-agent) are allowed to search the site and which directorys they are not allowed to search (keyword Disallow).

It's not possible to have a robots.txt on a site with a shared host. However using a virtual host would make it possible. I set my robots.txt to not allow any robots anywhere. I'm private!

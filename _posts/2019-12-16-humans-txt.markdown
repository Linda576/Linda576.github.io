 Humans.txt is a TXT file with information about the people who have contributed to building the website. The point of the txt-file, is to make the people behind the website known to the sites visitors without being intrusive with the code. An added txt file is an external, fast, easy and accessible way to prove your authorship (not your property).
 Anyone who have been a contributer to the creation of the site may be mentioned in the humans.txt-file, if they wish to be mentioned and the txt-file may also contain contact-info and general information about the creation of the site. The humans.txt file is placed in the site root, next to the robots.txt. Guidelines to make the humans.txt as standard as possible can be found here:  http://humanstxt.org/humans.txt, created by Abel Cabans.

 My humans.txt follows the standard mentioned, but is quite small, I'm the only team-member.

Pre-compiled css helps to avoid copying code, because variables and other features make it possible to reuse code instead. This is useful when building larger websites, where stylesheets tend to grow big and become cluttered and ultimately difficult to read. 
when creating this blog I used the SSG jekyll minima-theme template-scss-file and made some smaller alterations in it. It is definitely a good thing, to be able to avoid writing the same code multiple times, however it's a bit tricky to figure out how to best use it. For smaller projects I'm not sure it makes that much of a difference. 
Using a Static Site Generator such as Jekyll can be a timesaver once you've learnt it.

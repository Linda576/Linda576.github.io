To be able to use Disqus, a personal Disqus-account i necessary. Once you have that, simply add the disqus-shortname to the _config.yml-file. There is a disqus_comments.html-template file with the required code and the file is already included in post.html-template. In order to get disqus up and running, also remember to add the url to your site in _config.yml.
